## SHIP SECTION DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

For "Perfectly Balanced Ship Sections", we aim to:
1. Provide meaningful choices between different section layouts
2. Allow overpowered combinations but avoid game-breaking designs
3. Maintain tactical depth and strategic variety
4. Support ALL vanilla ship classes and DLC variants that players can build
5. Future compatibility with ACOT and other popular mods
6. Include crisis ships, special colony ships, and colossal ships
7. Cover both military and civilian vessels

Each ship class will have multiple section variants offering different trade-offs between:
- Firepower vs Defense
- Speed vs Armor
- Utility vs Combat
- Early-game vs Late-game optimization
- Specialized roles (anti-shield, anti-armor, area denial, etc.)
